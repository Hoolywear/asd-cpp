## Algorithms and Data Structures in C++

This repository contains a C++ implementation of various algorithms and data structures discussed during the *Algorithms and Data Structures* class from the Computer Science course, held at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Unimore) by professor Manuela Montangero. It will be mostly used for consultation and to practice the use of version control systems.

All the code you'll find in the repo *should* be correct (as it's moderately tested and based on a university program), still can't guarantee 100%.
